With this proyect we will be able to handle the data of the victims we obtain with Baphomet Ransomware.
BaphoDashBoard is developed in C# under frame work dotnet-core 3.1. Both Baphomet Ransomware and BaphoDashBoard proyects are
thrown out for educational purposes and so we can get something out of it to learn new things.

**DashBoard features**

* Generate .exe to encrypt data.
* Generate .exe to decrypt data.
* When we generate the ransomware, we keep the rsa keys that encrypt the symmetric key in charge of encrypting the files.
* Location of each victim shown on map.
* Graphics for better visualization.
* We can obtain the data of all our hosting servers.
* Handling of each baphomet.exe that we generate.
* Victims details and more using web scraping.


**Requirements**

* Dotnet core 3.1
* SDK & RunTime download link: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1

**Operating systems tested to date to run Bapho-Dashboard**

* Windows 10

**File that we must modify**

* file: BaphoDashBoard > Dal > Services > BaseService.cs line: 32
* NOTE: We add the hosting that contains the victim's data. for example https://myhosting.com/data.txt
