With this proyect we will be able to handle the data of the victims we obtain with Baphomet Ransomware.
BaphoDashBoard is developed in C# under frame work dotnet-core 3.1. Both Baphomet Ransomware and BaphoDashBoard proyects are
thrown out for educational purposes and so we can get something out of it to learn new things.

**DashBoard features**

* Location of each victim shown on map.
* Graphics for better visualization.
* We can obtain the data of all our hosting servers.
* Handling of each baphomet.exe that we generate.
* Victims details and more using web scraping.
